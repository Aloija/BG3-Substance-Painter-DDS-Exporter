Baldur's Gate 3 Substance Painter DDS Exporter
</h1>


A Substance Painter DDS export plugin to automate the PNG to DDS conversion.

It's originally Starfield plugin I remade to fit Baldur's Gate 3 textures format.

# Installation:
Extract the bg3-dds-exporter.py into your Substance Painter Plugin folder:
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\python\plugins
</pre>

(Can also be found using the Python > Plugins Folder button in the top row)

Export your textures in .tga format with correct suffixes in a file name ("BM", "NM", "HMVY", "CLEA", "MSKA", "PM", "MSK", "GM")

## Enable the BG3-DDS-Exporter under the Python menu
First time running the plugin it will ask you what folder the Texconv.exe is located in via a UI pop-up. This will create a BG3-DDS-Exporter-PluginSettings.ini in the plugin folder with the settings saved.

## Export preset:
Move the BaldursGate3_Props.spexp and BaldursGate3_Skin.spexp to this folder:

C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\assets\export-presets

Add additional channels in Texture set settings like below:
