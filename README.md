Baldur's Gate 3 Substance Painter DDS Exporter
</h1>


A Substance Painter DDS export plugin to automate the PNG to DDS conversion.

It's originally Starfield plugin I remade to fit Baldur's Gate 3 textures format.

# Installation:
Extract the bg3-dds-exporter.py into your Substance Painter Plugin folder:
<pre>
C:\Users\username\Documents\Adobe\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\python\plugins
</pre>

(Can also be found using the Python > Plugins Folder button in the top row)

## Enable the BG3-DDS-Exporter under the Python menu
First time running the plugin it will ask you what folder the Texconv.exe is located in via a UI pop-up. This will create a Starfield-DDS-Exporter-PluginSettings.ini in the plugin folder with the settings saved.

# Dependencies:
Microsoft Texconv (Download and extract to whatever folder you want)

https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv

# Compatibility
Developed and tested with Substance Painter 9.1.1 (2023)
